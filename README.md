# BullCowGame

BullCow is a game I developed with Unreal Engine 4 as part of my learning of C++/UE4 with Udemy.

The game is setup in a 3D Unreal environment, but works just like a console game.

The player can access the console (represented by a signboard) and play the game.

The game generates hundreds of isograms and randomly picks one to be the key at each round.

The player is given the length of the word and has to guess what it is.

The game returns the Bulls and Cows according to the player's guess, which hints as to which letters are right or wrong and whether they are in the right position.
